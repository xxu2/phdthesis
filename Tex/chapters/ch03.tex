\chapter{Optimizing Species-Specified Aerosol Emissions} \label{chap:}

\section{Introduction}

 In this chapter, we present a new attempt for the top-down estimate 
 of aerosol emissions through integration of the satellite observation 
 of reflectance and GEOS-Chem Adjoint model. 
 The technique is applied to improve estimates of mineral dust 
 and anthropogenic \ce{SO2}, \ce{NH3}, \ce{NOx}, \ce{BC} and \ce{OC} 
 emissions over China for April 2008, during which ground-based 
 PM\textsubscript{10} (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter of 
 10 $\mu$m or less) data is available from a joint China-U.S. 
 dust field experiment [Huang et al., 2010]. 
 This paper differs from the past work in that: 
 (i) satellite reflectance (in essence radiance) is used 
 to constrain the emission estimates of aerosol particle and precursors, 
 which eliminates the discrepancy of aerosol optical properties 
 between model simulated and satellite retrieved AOD; 
 (ii) we use a suite of aerosol and gas measurements 
 from satellite sensors and ground-based instruments 
 to independently evaluate our results, and test our hypothesis 
 that temporal variation of AOD at different locations, 
 as characterized by satellite observations, can be a strong constraint 
 for species-specific source estimates if they are combined with 
 the model-based knowledge of the dominant aerosol sources 
 and the source-receptor relationship at corresponding locations; 
 and (iii) combination of (i) and (ii) will provide the basis and 
 a necessary step forward for future research to simultaneously 
 use both gas and AOD measurements to constrain speciated aerosol emissions. 

 We describe the top-down inversion scheme and its key components 
 (i.e., GEOS-Chem forward model and its adjoint, and observational constraints) 
 in Section 2. The top-down constraints on aerosol emissions over China 
 for the period of April 2008 are presented in Section 3, 
 and evaluated in Section 4. Interpretation and 
 implications of the results are discussed in Section 5, 
 and Section 6 summaries this study. [needs updates!!!!]

 \end{figure}

 As shown in Figure \ref{fig:flowchat}, the top-down inversion approach in this study 
 integrates the MODIS radiance/reflectance with the GEOS-Chem (section 2.1) 
 and its adjoint model (section 2.2) to optimize aerosol emissions. 
 First, similar to Wang et al. [2010], we retrieve the atmospheric 
 aerosol mass and AOD through fitting the calculated radiance based on 
 GEOS-Chem aerosol composition and single optical properties to the MODIS 
 cloud-free radiances (section 2.3). Second, the retrieved AOD 
 (hereafter retrieved MODIS AOD) from the first step is used as 
 an observational constraint to optimize the aerosol emissions 
 by inverting the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model (section 2.4). 
 The approach aims to improve aerosol emission estimates that ultimately 
 will yield better agreement between model simulated and satellite-observed 
 reflectances.  Since the aerosol single scattering properties are 
 exactly the same between the retrieval algorithm and GEOS-Chem 
 (as done in the first step), the top-down inversion scheme essentially 
 uses the MODIS radiances (in the form of retrieved AOD) to scale the 
 GEOS-Chem aerosol mass, which in turn are used to optimally adjust 
 the aerosol emissions. The approach here is first demonstrated through 
 a pseudo-observation experiment (Section 2.5) before it is applied 
 to real observations (Section 3).
